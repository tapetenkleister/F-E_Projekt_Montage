Button "Detect assembly step" 

By pressing the button the file detect_btn.py will be executed.
This calls the individual functions to detect the assembly progress. 
The photos saved by this are then displayed in the interface. 
In the bottom right corner, the last completed assembly step is displayed. 

Button "Take photo"

By pressing the button the file take_image_btn is executed.
This takes a picture with the IDS camera, saves it and then displays it on the interface. 

Button "Save new template"

With the help of the "Save new Template" button, a new component can be entered. 
Templates of the individual construction steps must first be created using the free Stud.io software. 
The templates show the individual construction steps as a top view. 
The images of the individual construction steps must be numbered consecutively. 
An overview image is also added to the folder as <TemplateName>_thumbnail.png. 
As soon as the button is pressed, the user is prompted to enter the name of the new template. 
It is important that the name is capitalized. 
Next, the number of knobs on the longest side of the structure must be provided. 
Subsequently, a window opens where the folder with the templates is to be selected. 
The photos from the selected folder will be copied to the newly created folder. 
Finally, we call the save_new_matrix, which creates a .json file for the new template.
